\section{Non-interactive blockchain proofs}

A non-interactive proof-of-proof of work is a game between a Prover and a
Verifier parameterized by predicate $q$ which the prover tries to convince the
verifier for. The predicate $q$ is a function of a chain $\chain$, which the
prover claims to be the longest chain.

At the beginning of the game, two Provers generate proofs $\pi_A$, $\pi_B$
claiming potentially different truth values for the predicate $q$ based on
their claimed local longest chains. The Verifier receives these proofs and
accepts one of the two proofs, determining the truth value of the predicate.
