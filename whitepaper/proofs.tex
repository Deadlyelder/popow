\section{Constructing non-interactive proofs}

A non-interactive proof-of-proof of work is a game between a Prover and a
Verifier parameterized by predicate $q$ which the prover tries to convience the
verifier for. The predicate $q$ is a function of a chain $\chain$, which the
prover claims to be the longest chain.

\import{./}{algorithms/alg.verifier-framework.tex}
\import{./}{algorithms/alg.verifier-full.tex}
\import{./}{algorithms/alg.verifier-lite.tex}

At the beginning of the game, two Provers generate proofs $\pi_A$, $\pi_B$
claiming potentially different truth values for the predicate $q$ based on
their claimed local longest chains. The Verifier receives these proofs and
accepts one of the two proofs, determining the truth value of the predicate.

We introduce a helper algorithm, ConstructInnerChain, shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg.nipopow_construct_innerchain}. This algorithm returns the innerchain
of level $i$ extracted from the blockchain $\chain$. If boundary is provided,
it only returns the blocks more recent than the boundary block supplied.

\import{./}{algorithms/alg.nipopow-prover.tex}

The NiPoPoW proof construction is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg.nipopow_construct_proof}.
This produces a non-interactive PoPoW in parameter $m$ which consists of a
number of blocks for every level $i$. The number of blocks per level is
approximately $2m$.
