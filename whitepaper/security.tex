\subsection{Security}

\begin{lemma}
    If the maximum level superchain belonging to the honest parties of at least
    $m$ blocks is of level $\mu$, then the adversary cannot produce a
    superchain of level better than $\mu + 1$ with at least $m$ blocks except
    with negligible probability.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    ???
\end{proof}

Based on the above, observe that the adversarial proof cannot exceed the
superblock level of the honest proof by more than one, except with negligible
probability. Therefore, proofs that are of much inferior superblock level can
be rejected immediately. This allows us to assume that for two competing proofs
$\overline{\Pi}_\alpha$ and $\overline{\Pi}_\beta$ it holds that
$||\overline{\Pi}_A| - |\overline{\Pi}_B|| \leq 1$.

\begin{theorem}
    The non-interactive proofs-of-proof-of-work construction is secure.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\overline{\Pi}_A, \overline{\Pi}_B$ be an adversarial and an honest
    proof respectively.

    Let $b$ be the LCA of $\overline{\Pi}_A$ and $\overline{\Pi}_B$ and assume
    that $A$ is the adversary. Let $\mu$ be the highest level at which one of $A$
    or $B$ is able to present $m$ blocks of level $\mu$ after $b$. We will show
    that if such a level exists, then the winning proof will necessarily be
    $\overline{\Pi}_B$.

    Indeed, because $\mu$ is the highest level at which any of the parties was
    able to present at least $m$ blocks of that level after $b$, this means
    that at every higher level $\mu + i$, it was true that $b$ was within the
    last $m$ blocks of that level. Therefore, $B$, due to the way the proofs
    are constructed, would have included all the blocks following $b$ of that
    level. Hence, all the blocks of the honest chain following $b$ of level
    $\mu$ have been included in the proof $\overline{\Pi}_B$.

    This means that the blocks presented after $b$ by $B$ at level $\mu$ must
    be disjoint from those presented after $b$ by $A$ at level $\mu$, since $b$
    is defined as the LCA. But because $B$ presented all the honest chain
    blocks of level $\mu$, therefore the $m$ blocks presented by $A$ at level
    $\mu$ must be adversarially mined.  However, because both the honest
    parties and the adversary started mining blocks of level $\mu$
    simultaneously after the round during which block $b$ was generated, the
    probability that the adversary is able to produce $m$ $\mu$-level blocks
    after block $b$ faster than the honest parties are able to produce $m$
    $\mu$-level blocks after block $b$ is negligible.

    Therefore, if there exists such a level $\mu$, then the honest party proof
    will necessarily win. If there is no such level $\mu$, then the comparison
    happens at the 0-level, and hence reduces to the security of a full
    verifier.
\end{proof}

The critical issue addressed by this security proof is to avoid Bahack-style
attack \cite{bahack} where the adversary constructs ``lucky'' high-difficulty
superblocks without filling in the underlying proof-of-work in the lower
levels. Observe that, while setting $m = 1$ ``preserves'' the proof-of-work in
the sense that expectations remain the same, the probability of an adversarial
attack becomes approximately proportional to the adversary power if the
adversary follows a suitable strategy (for a description of such a strategy,
see the parametrization section). With higher values of $m$, the probability of
an adversarial attack drops exponentially, even though they maintain constant
computational power, and hence satisfy a strong notion of security.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%         We will enforce both a lower bound and an upper bound for the length of
%         each superchain in the proof. The lower bound will be $m$. The upper
%         bound could be something like $5m$ or $m^2$? We want a limit such that
%         the probability of the proof requiring this size for an honest party is
%         negligible, therefore larger proofs can be automatically dismissed as
%         adversarial. That way we can ensure that the proofs will necessarily be
%         sublinear in size, but can also help with the security proof.
%     \item
%         When comparing an adversarial and an honest proof, they can be at the
%         same level or at different levels.
%     \item
%         If they are at the same level, then the lowest common ancestor of the
%         two chains will necessarily be close to the end of the proof, except
%         with negligible probability. This stems from the fact that in the
%         opposite case, the adversary would have to produce proof-of-work faster
%         than the honest parties and for a significant amount of time.
%     \item
%         Therefore, if the proofs are at the same level, they can be compared by
%         recursing into a lower level, one level at a time. The negligibility
%         argument for the lowest common ancestor being near the suffix applies
%         to all levels, and hence recursion should be possible.
%     \item
%         If the adversarial proof is of a higher superblock level than the
%         honest proof, then this proof will necessarily extend some honest block
%         included in the honest proof. If the honest proof is of level $\mu$ and
%         the adversarial proof is of level $\mu + 1$ this means that the
%         adversary was able to produce one or more $(\mu + 1)$-level blocks
%         which extended the $(\mu + 1)$-level blocks that exist in the
%         $\mu$-level proof of the honest parties.
%     \item
%         By the previous reasoning, the adversary should not be able to produce
%         too many of these independently of the honest party, and therefore they
%         will share a lowest common ancestor near the suffix. Proofs comparison
%         can therefore continue recursively.
%     \item
%         It seems unlikely that the adversary will be able to present a proof of
%         a higher level than the honest parties for $i >> 1$ or even $i > 1$.
%         Perhaps we can think of a formal argument for this.
%     \item
%         In case the adversarial proof is of a lower level than the honest
%         proof, it still cannot exceed the enforced upper bound of proof size.
%         Assume the upper bound were $2m$. That would necessarily entail that
%         the honest party has more proof of work than the adversarial party.
%         Does the same argument work for other upper bounds?
%     \item
%         In the above, proof-of-work amount comparison must cross different
%         superchains. i.e. the total amount of proof of work considered in each
%         case must be a weighted sum of proof-of-work for each level.
%     \item
%         This weighted sum could look as follows:
%         \begin{equation}
%             PoW =
%             \sum_{j = \mu}^{\mu + i}
%             {|\overline{\Pi}_j \setminus \overline{\Pi}_{j - 1}|}
%             + \overline{\Pi}_{\mu - 1}
%         \end{equation}
%     \item
%         When the adversary presents a lower-level superchain of level $\mu$:
%         The honest party has already presented a lower-level superchain of at
%         least $m$ blocks. The adversarial lower-level superchain can share some
%         block of these at level $\mu$ (note that the honest party has not
%         provided $\mu$-level superblocks all the way back to genesis, so a
%         common ancestor does not trivially exist). If they share a lowest
%         common ancestor within the $m$ blocks of level $\mu$ presented by the
%         honest party, then the proof comparison can continue as usual.
%     \item
%         On the other hand, if there are no shared blocks between the
%         adversarial proof and the $\mu$-level superchain of the honest proof,
%         then that means that the adversary has either produced their own
%         $\mu$-level blocks or has reused earlier $\mu$-level honest blocks.
%     \item
%         Reusing $\mu$-level honest blocks cannot be done arbitrarily. Once
%         enough blocks have been used, the proof will be upgraded to $\mu +
%         1$-level.
%     \item
%         Adversarially producing $\mu$-level blocks is possible, but $\mu +
%         1$-level blocks generated during this adversarial mining procedure must
%         be discarded after $m - 1$ blocks of superblock level $\mu + 1$ have
%         been generated.
%     \item
%         The argument then goes as follows: Assuming honest superblock proof
%         level $\mu + i$, it is hard for the adversary to produce $m$ blocks of
%         level $\mu + i - 1$, while the honest proof already has $m$ blocks of
%         that level. It becomes easier for the adversary as we approach level
%         $\mu$. But proof-of-work has to be added across multiple levels to
%         achieve a fair comparison. I'm not sure how to do that exactly.
%     \item
%         Note than in practice succinct proofs are just sets of blocks. The
%         proof level is therefore extracted by the validator by comparing
%         the blockids against $T / 2^i$.
% \end{itemize}
