\section{Constructing blockchain proofs}

We introduce a helper algorithm, constructInnerChain, shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg.nipopow-innerchain}. This algorithm returns the innerchain
of level $i$ extracted from the blockchain $\chain$. If boundary is provided,
it only returns the blocks more recent than the boundary block supplied.

The NiPoPoW proof construction is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg.nipopow-construct-proof}.
This produces a non-interactive PoPoW in parameter $m$ which consists of a
number of blocks for every level $i$. The number of blocks per level is
approximately $2m$.
