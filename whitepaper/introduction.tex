\section{Introduction}

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin~\cite{bitcoin} and Ethereum~\cite{ethereum}
have seen tremendous success in recent years. These are peer-to-peer networks
that maintain a globally consistent transaction ledger, using a new consensus
protocol based on proof-of-work (PoW) puzzles. Worker nodes called ``miners''
expend computational work in order to reach agreement on the state of the
network. Clients on the network, such as mobile phone apps, must verify these
proofs-of-work in order to determine the correct view of the network's state, as
necessary to transmit and receive payments.

In this work we introduce, analyze and instantiate a new primitive,
Noninteractive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs), which can be adapted into
existing cryptocurrencies to support more efficient clients. A traditional
blockchain client must verify the entire chain of proofs-of-work, which grows
linearly over time. On the contrary, clients based on NIPoPoWs require resources
only logarithmic in the length of the blockchain.

There are three trends that motivate the need for more efficient clients,
specifically clients that can verify transactions without having to process the
whole blockchain. First, while Bitcoin remains by far the largest and most
widely used cryptocurrency, the ecosystem has become significantly more diverse.
Today there are hundreds of competitors, commonly called ``altcoins'', and
Bitcoin's dominance in the market is at an all time low
~\cite{marketcap}.\footnote{There are numerous problems with using  market
capitalization as a measure of economic size, such as defining what it means to
quantify the quantity ``in circulation''; further quantifying this is outside
the scope of our paper.} We envision that our protocol will form the basis of an
efficient multi-blockchain client, which could efficiently support payments
using hundreds of separate cryptocurrencies.

Second, cryptocurrencies are increasingly used as components of larger systems
(the cryptocurrency system is typically called a ``blockchain'' when its
currency feature is not salient). As one example, a recent system called
Catena~\cite{catena} uses the Bitcoin blockchain as an authenticated log; the
browser embeds a Bitcoin client that uses the blockchain to validate HTTPS
certificates. The bandwidth costs that are tolerable for a dedicated Bitcoin
wallet are likely unacceptable in such embedded contexts. Our techniques can
directly reduce the cost of Catena and similar systems.

Finally, there has been significant interest in the development of
``cross-chain'' applications, i.e. logical transactions that span multiple
separate cryptocurrencies. Simple cross-chain transactions are feasible today:
the most well-known is the atomic exchange ~\cite{tiernolan} e.g. a trade of
Bitcoins for Ether. However, more sophisticated applications could be enabled
by our protocol, which would allow one cryptocurrency to embed a client of a
separate cryptocurrency. This concept initially popularized by a proposal by
Back et al. ~\cite{sidechains} particularly can be used to avoid a difficult
upgrade process: a new blockchain with additional features, such as
experimental opcodes, can be backed by deposits in the original Bitcoin
currency, obviating the need to bootstrap new currencies from scratch. This
has been heralded as a key enabling scalability of the Bitcoin ecosystem;
however, the sidechains proposal is incomplete, as it does not provide a
protocol that satisfies a natural security definition, i.e. where attacks
succeed with only negligible probability. Our work is the first to answer the
open problem posed by Back et al.

\noindent
\paragraph{Our contributions.}
In summary, we make the following contributions in this paper.

Our main technical contribution is the introduction of a new cryptographic
primitive called Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work (NIPoPoW). We present a
formal model and a provably secure instantiation of NIPoPoWs in the model of
\cite{backbone}. Our contribution builds on previous work by Kiayias et al. who
posed interactive proofs of proof-of-work \cite{KLS}, which, in turn, are based
on previous discussion of such concepts in the bitcoin forums \cite{highway}.
Our definition fills the gap in terms of security modeling and design that
existed in previous proposals, especially the notion of cumulative ``Dynamic
Member Multisignature'' by Back et al. \cite{sidechains}. Moreover it is also
the first truly non-interactive PoPoW since even the efficient PoPoW
construction of \cite{KLS} is susceptible to forced interactions when an
adversarial prover is present.

We provide concrete parameterization and empirical analysis focusing to show the
potential savings of our approach versus existing clients. Using actual data
from the bitcoin blockchain we quantify the actual savings of NIPoPoWs over the
previous known techniques of constructing efficient SPV verifiers.

We describe two practical deployment paths for our NIPoPoWs that existing
cryptocurrencies can  adopt to support our efficient clients. Specifically, we
first outline how NiPoPoW's can be deployed using either a ``soft fork'' or a
``hard fork'' ugprade procedure, both of which have been successfuly used by
existing cryptocurrencies. We then present a less disruptive update mechanism
that we term a ``velvet fork'' and which may be of independent interest. In a
velvet fork update the clients that have ``forked'' from the original
implementation continue to be fully compatible with unupdated clients. It
follows that in a velvet fork, the blockchain system can remain supported by a
diverse software codebase indefinitely, while it can still enjoy, at least in
proportion, some of the (efficiency in our case) benefits of the update without
any of the  security downsides.
