\section{Consensus layer changes}

For our proofs to work, we require certain changes in the consensus layer.
An interlink data structure is proposed to be included in each block, replacing
the existing pointer to the previous block with a list of pointers to a small
number of previous blocks. The algorithm for this construction is shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg.nipopow-interlink} and is borrowed from \cite{KLS}. By
convention, we assume that the Genesis block is of infinite level and hence a
pointer to it is included in every block at the first available index within
the interlink data structure.

Some helper functions are defined in Algorithm~\ref{alg.nipopow-helper}, which
will become useful for future algorithms also.
