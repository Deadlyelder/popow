\begin{proof}
    Because $\mu_B$ is the compared level of the honest party we have:

    $2^{\mu_B}|\chain\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B}| > 2^{\mu_B}|\chain\{b:\}|$

    We will prove the claim by contradiction. Suppose $\mu_B' < \mu_B$. Because
    by definition $\mu_B'$ is the maximum level such that
    $|\pi_B\{b:\}\upchain^\mu[1:]| \geq \max(m, (1 -
    \delta)2^{-\mu}|\pi_B\{b:\}\upchain^\mu[1:]\downchain|)$, therefore
    $\mu_B$ does not satisfy this condition. But we know that
    $|\pi_B\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B}[1:]| \geq m$ because $\mu_B$ was selected by
    the Verifier. So therefore,

    \begin{equation*}
    2^{\mu_B}|\chain_B\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B}| < (1 - \delta)|\chain\{b:\}|
    \end{equation*}

    By the fact that $\mu_B'$ satisfies goodness, we have that:

    \begin{equation*}
    2^{\mu_B'}|\chain_B\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B'} > (1 - \delta)|\chain\{b:\}|
    \end{equation*}

    From the last two equations, we obtain that:

    \begin{equation*}
    (1 - \delta)|\chain\{b:\}| > 2^{\mu_B'}|\chain\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B'}|
    \end{equation*}

    But the last two equations contradict, hence the claim holds.
    \Qed
