\begin{proof}
    $\pi\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu'} \subseteq \chain\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu'}$ is trivial.

    For the converse, we will show that for all $\mu^* > \mu'$, we have that in
    the iteration of the Prove \texttt{for} loop with $\mu = \mu^*$, the block
    stored in variable $B$ preceeds block $b$ in $\chain$.

    Suppose $\mu = \mu^*$ is the first \texttt{for} loop iteration during which the
    property is violated. Clearly this cannot be the first iteration, as there
    $B = \chain[0]$ and Genesis preceeds all blocks, including itself. By the
    induction hypothesis we see that during the iteration $\mu = \mu^* + 1$,
    block $B$ preceeded block $b$. But from the definition of $\mu'$ we know
    that $\mu'$ is the highest level for which
    $|\pi\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu'}[1:]|
    \geq \max(m, (1 -
    \delta)2^{-\mu'}|\pi\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu'}[1:]\downchain|)$.

    Hence, this
    property cannot hold for $\mu^* > \mu'$ and therefore
    $|\pi_B\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B^*}[1:]| < m$ or $\lnot
    \textsf{local-good}_\delta(\pi\{b:\}\upchain{\mu^*}[1:], \chain, \mu^*)$.

    In case \textsf{local-good} is violated, variable $B$ remains unmodified and
    the induction step holds. If \textsf{local-good} is not violated, then
    $|\pi\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu^*}[1:]| < m$ and so $\pi\upchain^{\mu^*}[-m]$
    preceeds $b$, and so we are done.
