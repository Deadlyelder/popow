\begin{proof}
    % \dznote{What is $S$? You need to condition it on the random oracle
    % giving the right output.}

    Let $S$ be the set of all blocks successfully produced by the honest
    parties or the adversary. Because each block id is generated by the random
    oracle, the probability that it is less than $T 2^{-\mu}$ is
    $2^{-\mu}$. These are independent Bernoulli trials. For each block
    $B \in S$, define $X^{\mu}_B \in \{0, 1\}$ to be the random variable
    indicating whether the block belongs to superblock level $\mu$ and let
    $D_\mu$ indicate their sum, which is a Binomial distribution with
    parameters $(|S|, 2^{-\mu})$ and expected value $E[D_{\mu}] =
    |S| 2^{-\mu}$.

    For level $\mu$ to exist in any valid proof, at least $m$ blocks of level
    $\mu$ must have been produced by the honest parties or the adversary. We
    will now show that $m$ blocks of level $\mu = \log(|S|)$ are produced with
    negligible probability in $m$.

    As all of the $X^{\mu}$ are independent, we can apply a Binomial Chernoff
    bound to the probability of the sum. Therefore we have

    $\Pr[D_\mu \geq (1 + \Delta)E[D_\mu]] \leq \exp(-\frac{\Delta^2}{2 +
    \Delta}E[D_\mu])$. But for this $\mu$ we have that $E[D_\mu] = 1$.
    Therefore $\Pr[D_\mu \geq 1 + \Delta] \leq \exp(-\frac{\Delta^2}{2 +
    \Delta})$. Requiring $1 + \Delta = m$, we get $\Pr[D_\mu \geq m] \leq
    \exp(-\frac{(m - 1)^2}{m + 1})$, which is negligible in $m$.
    \qed
