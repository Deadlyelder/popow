\begin{proof}
    Let $m = k_1 + k_2$ and let $k_1 = k_1(\kappa)$ and $k_2 = k_2(\kappa)$ be
    polynomial functions of the security parameter $\kappa$.

    We will prove security by reductio ad absurdum. Assume a typical execution.
    Let $\overline{\Pi}_A, \overline{\Pi}_B$ be an adversarial and an honest
    proof respectively, and assume the security property is violated. That is,
    the honest verifier is convinced that $Q(\chain)$ has a value different
    from all honest full nodes.

    Let $r_3$ be the round during which the honest proof $\overline{\Pi}_B$ was
    constructed; that is, the current round. $\overline{\Pi}_B$ will be a proof
    constructed based on an underlying blockchain $\chain_B$.

    Let $b$ be the LCA of $\overline{\Pi}_A$ and $\overline{\Pi}_B$ and assume
    that $A$ is the adversary. Let $\mu$ be the highest level at which $A$
    is able to present $m$ blocks of level $\mu$ after $b$. We will first show
    that the two chains after $b$ are disjoint. Because $A$ is winning,
    therefore $\mu$ is the highest level at which any of the parties was able
    to present at least $m$ blocks of that level after $b$.  This means that at
    every higher level $\mu + i$ for $i > 0$, it was true that $b$ was within
    the last $m$ blocks of that level.  Therefore, $B$, due to the way the
    proofs are constructed, would have included all the blocks following $b$ of
    that level. Hence, all the blocks of the honest chain following $b$ of
    level $\mu$ have been included in the proof $\overline{\Pi}_B$.

    Let $\chain'_A$ be the adversarial $\mu$-level superchain after block $b$
    and $\chain'_B$ be the honest party's $\mu$-level superchain after block
    $b$.  These two chains will be disjoint since $b$ is defined as the LCA.

    We will now show that $\chain'_A[k_1 + 1:]$ contains no honestly mined
    blocks. By contradiction, assume that the block $\chain'_A[i]$ for some $i
    > k_1 + 1$ was honestly generated. But this means that an honest party had
    adopted the chain $\chain'_A[i - 1]$ at some round $r_2 \leq r_3$. Because
    of the way the honest parties adopt chains, this means that the superchain
    $\chain'_A[:i - 1]$ has an underlying properly constructed $0$-level chain
    $\chain_A$ which starts at genesis and includes all the blocks of the
    superchain $\chain'_A[:i - 1]$. Let $j$ be the index of block $b$ within
    $\chain_A$.  As $\chain_A$ contains at least all the blocks of the
    superchain $\chain'_A$, observe that $|\chain_A[j + 1:]| \geq i - 1 > k_1$.
    Therefore $\chain_A[:-k_1] \not\preccurlyeq \chain_B$. But, as $\chain_A$
    was adopted by an honest party at round $r_2$ which is prior to round $r_3$
    during which $\chain_B$ was adopted by an honest party, this contradicts
    the Common Prefix property of blockchains. It follows that with
    overwhelming probability in $k_1$, the $k_2 = m - k_1$ last blocks of the
    adversarial proof have been adversarially mined.

    Let $b'$ be the most recent honest block preceeding $b$, which could be the
    genesis block, and let $r_1$ be the round during which $b'$ was generated.
    We will consider the set of consecutive rounds $S$ starting at round $r_1$
    and ending at round $r_3$. We are considering a superchain of level $\mu$
    which has at least $m$ blocks, and hence the random oracle must have
    answered at least $m$ queries with a value $v < 2^{-\mu}T$ during $S$. From
    the assumption that the execution is typical, it follows that $Z^\mu(S)$
    and $X^\mu(S)$ are distributed close to their respective means. But the
    probability that the adversary is able to produce $k_2$ $\mu$-level blocks
    after block $b'$ faster than the honest parties are able to produce $m$
    $\mu$-level blocks after block $b'$ is negligible.

    The last case to consider is if there is no such level $\mu$. But then the
    comparison by the verifier happens at the $0$-level, and hence reduces to
    the security of a full verifier. Due to the common prefix property at level
    $0$ and the fact that the predicate $Q$ is stable, it follows that the
    adversary cannot present a chain which will be accepted by an honest full
    verifier and have a different value for $Q$.
\end{proof}
