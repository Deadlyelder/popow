\begin{proof}
    Let $\overline{\Pi}_A, \overline{\Pi}_B$ be an adversarial and an honest
    proof respectively.

    Let $b$ be the LCA of $\overline{\Pi}_A$ and $\overline{\Pi}_B$ and assume
    that $A$ is the adversary. Let $\mu$ be the highest level at which one of $A$
    or $B$ is able to present $m$ blocks of level $\mu$ after $b$. We will show
    that if such a level exists, then the winning proof will necessarily be
    $\overline{\Pi}_B$.

    Indeed, because $\mu$ is the highest level at which any of the parties was
    able to present at least $m$ blocks of that level after $b$, this means
    that at every higher level $\mu + i$, it was true that $b$ was within the
    last $m$ blocks of that level. Therefore, $B$, due to the way the proofs
    are constructed, would have included all the blocks following $b$ of that
    level. Hence, all the blocks of the honest chain following $b$ of level
    $\mu$ have been included in the proof $\overline{\Pi}_B$.

    This means that the blocks presented after $b$ by $B$ at level $\mu$ must
    be disjoint from those presented after $b$ by $A$ at level $\mu$, since $b$
    is defined as the LCA. But because $B$ presented all the honest chain
    blocks of level $\mu$, therefore the $m$ blocks presented by $A$ at level
    $\mu$ must be adversarially mined.  However, because both the honest
    parties and the adversary started mining blocks of level $\mu$
    simultaneously after the round during which block $b$ was generated, the
    probability that the adversary is able to produce $m$ $\mu$-level blocks
    after block $b$ faster than the honest parties are able to produce $m$
    $\mu$-level blocks after block $b$ is negligible.

    Therefore, if there exists such a level $\mu$, then the honest party proof
    will necessarily win. If there is no such level $\mu$, then the comparison
    happens at the 0-level, and hence reduces to the security of a full
    verifier.
\end{proof}
