\begin{proof}
    Assume the $(\mu - 1)$-level superchain had $4m$ blocks. Because each block
    of level $\mu - 1$ was generated as a query to the random oracle, it
    constitutes an independent Bernoulli trial and the number of blocks in
    level $\mu$, namely $\pi[\mu]$, is a Binomial distribution with parameters
    $(4m, 1/2)$. Applying a Chernoff bound to the
    distribution, we have that $\Pr[|\pi[\mu]| = m] \leq \Pr[|\pi[\mu]| \leq
    m]$. Observing that $E[\pi[mu]] = 2m$ the previous probability becomes
    $\Pr[|\pi[\mu]| \leq (1 - \frac{1}{2})2m] \leq \exp(-\frac{(1/2)^2}{2} 2m)$
    which is negligible in $m$.

    This probability bounds the probability of fewer
    than $m$ blocks occurring in the $\mu$ level restriction of $(\mu -
    1)$-level superchains of more than $4m$ blocks.
\end{proof}
