\section{Provable chain predicates}

We now describe the desirable property of predicates, \textit{monotonicity},
which is an adequate condition to show that the predicats are provable. Based
on predicate monotonicity, we show that a predicate has \textit{liveness} and
\textit{persistence} and define chain predicate security appropriately.

We allow our predicates to have an undefined value $\bot$ before they take
on a truth value of $0$ or $1$.

\begin{definition}{(Predicate monotonicity)}
    A chain predicate $Q(\chain)$ is $\textit{monotonic}$ if for all chains
    $\chain$ and for all blocks $B$ we have that:

    \begin{equation*}
        Q(\chain) \neq \bot \Rightarrow Q(\chain) = Q(\chain B)
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Predicate switching position)}
    A chain predicate $Q(\chain) \neq \bot$ has a switching position $i \in
    \mathbb{N}$ in the chain $\chain$ defined as the minimum $i$ such that:

    \begin{equation*}
        Q(\chain[:i]) \neq \bot
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Predicate stability)}
    Parameterized by $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and a chain $\chain$, a chain predicate
    $Q$ has $\textit{stability}$ if its switching position $i$ satisfies $i <
    |\chain| - k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Predicate persistence)}
    Parameterized by $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and a chain $\chain$, a chain predicate
    $Q$ has $\textit{persistence}$ if the following is true: When in a certain
    round the predicate is $k$-stable in some honest party's chain, then
    whenever it is $k$-stable in any honest party's chain, the truth value of
    the predicate is the same. Furthermore, the change of truth value from
    $\bot$ to its final truth value happened at the same blockchain depth.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Predicate liveness)}
    Parameterized by $u, k \in \mathbb{N}$ (the ``wait time'' and ``depth''
    parameters respectively) and a chain $\chain$, a chain predicate
    $Q$ has $\textit{liveness}$ if it is $k$-stable for one honest part
    in a certain round, then it will also be $k$-stable for all honest parties
    after $u$ rounds.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    If a chain predicate is monotonic, then it satisfies persistence with
    parameter $k = 2\eta \kappa f$ with probability at least $1 -
    e^{-\Omega(\kappa)}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Assume a typical execution and let $\chain_1$ be the chain of some honest
    player $P_1$ at round $r_1$. Assume that the chain predicate $Q(\chain)$ is
    $k$-stable for $P_1$ at round $r_1$, i.e.  $Q(\chain[:-k]) \neq \bot$.
    The chain of any honest player $P_2$ will be at least as long from the next
    round on and from common prefix we have that $\chain_1[:-k]
    \preccurlyeq \chain_2$. Therefore the predicate will be $k$-stable, have
    the same truth value, and have the same switching position for all honest
    parties.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    If a chain predicate is monotonic, then it satisfies liveness with
    parameters $u = 1$ rounds and $k = 2\eta \kappa f$ with probability at
    least $1 - e^{-\Omega(\kappa)}$.
\end{theorem}
