\section{Upgrading the consensus layer}

Our construction requires an upgrade to the bitcoin consensus layer. In this
section we outline a possible upgrade path for the bitcoin network. We propose
a solution that does not require a hard or soft fork. We achieve this by
providing the upgrade as a recommendation for miners and by not changing the
consensus rules for block acceptance.

TODO: Describe feather fork path
