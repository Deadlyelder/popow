\section{Upgrading the consensus layer}

Our construction requires an upgrade to the bitcoin consensus layer. In this
section we outline a possible upgrade path for the bitcoin network. The obvious
path forward for implementing our construction requires a soft or hard fork.
However, we show that we can achieve these changes without a fork, because
provers and verifiers of our protocol can check the validity of the claims of
unupgraded miners.  We achieve this by providing the upgrade as a
recommendation for miners and by not changing the consensus rules for block
acceptance. We term this a \textit{forkless fork}.
