\section{Future work}

Our security proof was constructed in the Backbone \cite{backbone} setting in
which the block difficulty is treated as a constant. 
It is easy to extend our construction to the variable difficulty setting. 
The only difference is that chains (and proofs) 
would have to be compared according to the total difficulty they possess, i.e., 
blocks at superlevel $\mu$ will by $\mu$ times more difficult
than $0$-level blocks. We conjecture
that this construction can be proven secure using a similar argumentation
as the one presented. The model in
\cite{backbone2} can be used as a basis and   we leave the full analysis  for
future work.

We worked with a construction that allows a certain class of chain predicates
to be proved: In particular, stable predicates which are functions only of the
$k$-suffix of the chain or pertain to the contents and order of subchains
containing a polylogarithmic number of blocks. However, slightly more general
predicates can also be proved succinctly. We leave the complete characeterization
of succinctly provable predicates for future work.
