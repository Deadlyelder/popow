\section{Future work}

Our security proof was constructed in the Backbone \cite{backbone} setting in
which the block difficulty is treated as a constant. We believe our
construction works in chains of variable difficulty as well. The model in
\cite{backbone2} can be used to proof such suitability, but we leave this for
future work.
