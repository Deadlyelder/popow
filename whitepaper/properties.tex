\section{Desired properties}

We now move on to define the various desired properties of a proof protocol, in
particular \textit{succinctness} and \textit{security}.

\begin{definition}{(Security)}
A \textit{blockchain proof protocol} is \textit{secure} if for all environments
and for all PPT adversaries $\mathcal{A}$ the output of $V$ on round $r$ is the
same as the evaluation of $Q(\chain)$ on all honest parties' chains $\chain$ as
long as $Q(\chain)$ is the same for all honest parties after round $r$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Succinctness)}
A \textit{blockchain proof protocol} is \textit{succinct} if the maximum proof
size $|\pi|$ across all honest provers for a given round $r$ is
$O(polylog(r))$.
\end{definition}

Based on these definitions, we now provide the model for a stateless typical
bitcoin SPV node in Algorithm~\ref{alg.verifier-full}. This verifier is
trivially secure, but not succinct.
